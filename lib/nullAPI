* [DOC] General usage:
*
*        ifp1
*        use   defsfile
*        use   nulldefs
*        use   spidefs
*        use   flashdefs
*        endc
*        use   nullAPI
*
* nullAPI is the API for NullFM and shared resource device drivers.
* It includes two routines: NFDirect and NFInitPB.
*
* NullFM manages shared resources, such as a SPI bus or a flash memory.
* It doesn't manage individual SPI peripherals or individual regions of
* a flash memory; a higher-level device driver must do that. NullFM and
* the associated shared resource device drivers are called only from
* system space, e.g. by higher-level device drivers.
*
* Each type of shared resource has a corresponding device class.
* Currently there are two device classes: NDC.SPI and NDC.FLASH.
*
* Although you can make certain OS9 _$____ calls to NullFM, they are
* passed through to the shared resource driver with undefined results.
*
* Normally you'll do this instead:
*
*   "Open" a NullFM shared resource device from a higher-level driver:
*   - OS9 I$Attach to the device; save Device Table Entry pointer returned in U
*
*   "Call" directly, repeatedly, asynchronously into the the shared resource device driver via NullFM:
*   - Load your Device Table Entry pointer into X
*   - Load a config handle, returned from a previous call, into A
*   - Build an NPB parameter block @Y (lbsr NFInitPB + other callback initialization)
*   - Load a shared resource driver function code into B
*   - Call into the driver (lbsr NFDirect)
*   - Most calls are asynchronous and return immediately WITHOUT BEING FINISHED
*   - Results are returned in the NPB parameter block, via the callback you provided
*
*   "Close" a NullFM device:
*     OS9 I$Detach using the saved Device Table Entry pointer in U
*


******************************
*
* [DOC] Functions supported by the NDC.SPI (SPI bus) device class:
*
* The SPI device class supports a SPI bus in master or slave mode (depending on hardware)
*
* When operating as a master:
* - Provide a select number in SPI.RDTC
* - Call SPI.TDT at will to transfer data
*   The SPI bus driver will allow time between selecting the slave and starting
*   the data transfer, based on the clock attributes specified in SPI.RDTC. This
*   means that the higher-level driver must be aware of any timing requirements
*   of the slave, in order to pass them on to NullFM and the shared resource driver.
*
* When operating as a slave:
* - Provide enable and disable callbacks in SPI.RDTC
* - Call SPI.TDT when selected (from your enable callback)
* - The master will need to allow enough time for interrupt service, buffer setup,
*   and your call back to SPI.TDT between selecting you and starting the transfer.
*   How this happens is master-specific and not controllable by a slave device.
*
* Function code SPI.DD: Deregister a Device
* - NBP.HNDL = handle to deregister
* - Errors: E$DevBsy, E$Param
*
* Function code SPI.ESM: Enter Slave Mode
* - NBP.HNDL = handle (slave mode)
* - NBP.U = ready callback
* - NBP.PRM0 = ready callback param
* - Errors: E$DevBsy, E$Param
*
* Function code SPI.XSM: Exit Slave Mode
* - NBP.HNDL = handle (slave mode)
* - Errors: E$DevBsy, E$Param, E$NotRdy
*
* Function code SPI.RDTC: Register Data Transfer Configuration
* - NBP.D = clock rate : clock attributes
* - NBP.X = disable callback (slave mode only)
* - NBP.Y = transfer attributes : select
* - NBP.U = enable callback (slave mode only)
* - NBP.PRM0 = enable callback param (slave mode only)
* - NBP.PRM1 = disable callback param (slave mode only)
* - Returns NBP.HNDL = handle
* - Errors: E$NoRam
*
* Function code SPI.TDT: Transfer Data to and from the Target
* - NBP.HNDL = handle 
* - NBP.B = (optional) constant data byte if transmit buffer is null 
* - NBP.X = transmit buffer (may be null)
* - NBP.Y = receive buffer (may be null)
* - NBP.U = completion callback
* - NBP.PRM0 = completion callback param 
* - NBP.PRM1 = buffer size
* - Errors: E$DevBsy, E$Param, E$NoRam

* [DOC] Functions supported by the NDC.FLASH (FLASH memory) device class:
*
* Function code FLA.DSIZE: Retrieve Number of Sectors and Current Sector Size
* - NBP.HNDL = Path number from F$Open
* - Returns NBP.PRM0 = # sectors
* - Returns NBP.PRM1 = Size of sector
* - Returns NBP.U = Size of smallest writeable region
* - Errors: E$BPNum
** Function code FLA.GSPOS: Retrieve the Current Path Position* - NBP.HNDL = Path number from F$Open
* - Returns NBP.X = MS word of position
* - Returns NBP.U = LS word of position
* - Errors: E$BPNum
** Function code FLA.SSPOS: Establish the Current Path Position
* - NBP.HNDL = Path number from F$Open
* - NBP.X = MS word of position
* - NBP.U = LS word of position
* - Errors: E$BPNum, E$Seek
