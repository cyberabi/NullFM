*
* Flash memory is a shared resource that can be divided into many
* sections / sectors to store data or parameters for multiple
* applications.
*
* The Flash driver associates with the NullFM fle manager allowing
* multiple higher-level device drivers to share flash memory.
*
* The data structures in this file give a flash memory its 'personality'
* and are used by higher-level drivers, NullFM, and flash memory
* device descriptors.
*
* All flash memories are NullFM device class NDC.FLASH.
